# SARdemo

A **very** crude demonstration of the principle of syntetic-aperture imaging. This is not a rigorous implementation.

The program simulates an aircraft flying by some reflective targets, taking repeated radar images. From this data, a recreation of the terrain is made by drawing circles centered at the aricraft, with radii corresponding to the distances of the target from the aircraft along the terrain.
